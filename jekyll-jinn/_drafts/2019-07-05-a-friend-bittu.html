<div id="__MailbirdStyleContent" style="font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial;color: #000000"><p class="MsoNormal">The Friend<o:p></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">"My father always used to say that when you die, if you've got five real friends, you've had a great life." —Lee Iacocca Friendships are an important part of a man's life. Friends are those men you can count on when the chips are down. They'll back you up even when the whole world is against you. Friends are those men who'll buy you a beer when you lose a job or your lady dumps you. Sadly the mighty bonds of man friendship have been greatly eroded during our modern age. The History of Man Friendships Men who know no differently accept the current state of man friendships as inevitable. But a brief look at the history of male friendship shows otherwise and points the way toward recapturing the glory of brotherly bonds. The Heroic Friendship In ancient times, men viewed male friendship as the most fulfilling relationship a person could have. Friendships were seen as nobler than marital love with a woman because women were seen as inferior. Aristotle and other philosophers extolled the virtues of platonic relationships—a relationship of emotional connection without sexual intimacy. Platonic relationships, according to Aristotle, were the ideal. During this period of time, the idea of the heroic friendship developed. The heroic friendship was a friendship between two men that was intense on an emotional and intellectual level. Heroic friends felt bound to protect one another from danger. Examples of heroic friendships exist in many ancient texts from the Bible (David and Jonathan) to ancient Greek writings (Achilles and Patroclus). Male Friendships in Colonial and NineteenthCentury America Male friendships during the colonial period and nineteenth century were marked by an intense bond and filled with sympathy and sentimentality. Friendships between men, in many instances, had a similar intensity as romantic relationships between men and women. Essentially it was a continuation of the heroic friendship of the ancient world, coupled with the emphasis on emotion common to the Romantic Age. A fervent bond did not necessarily imply a sexual relationship; the idea that these ardent friendships in some way compromised their heterosexuality is largely a modern conception. Men during this time freely used endearing language with each other in daily interaction and letters. And they weren't afraid to get all touchy-feely with one another either; many men would give no thought to draping their arms around their bud, sitting on one another's lap or even holding hands. It was also quite common for men to share a bed to save money. Men were free to have affectionate friendships with each other without fear of being called a queer because the modern concept of homosexuality and the strict straight/gay dichotomy did not yet exist. It wasn't until the turn of the twentieth century that psychologists started analyzing homosexuality. When that happened, men in America started to become much more self-conscious about their relationships with their friends and traded the close embraces for a stiff pat on the back. The man hug was born. Male Friendships in Twentieth-Century America "The better part of one's life consists of his friendships." —Abraham Lincoln The man friendship underwent serious transformations during the twentieth century. Men went from lavishing endearing words on each other and holding hands to avoiding too much emotional bonding or any sort of physical affections whatsoever. Fear of being called gay drove much of the transformation. Ministers and politicians decried homosexuality as being incompatible with true manhood. Figure 2.1 During the twentieth century, the man friendship went from lavishing endearing words on each other and holding hands to avoiding any sort of physical affections whatsoever. Additionally, the Industrial Revolution and the country's shift from an agrarian to a market economy affected the dynamics of all social relations. The resulting capitalistic culture, which gravitated to the new ideas of Social Darwinism and believed only the fittest would survive, influenced the way men viewed each other. Instead of being a potential friend, the man next to you became competition. In a dogeat-dog world, it's hard to get ahead when the guys you need to snack on are also your bosom buddies. Increased mobility during the twentieth century also contributed to the decline in male friendships. With more men following their work, it was hard to set down roots and make true friends. Man friendships did not die out of course, but the basis of the relationship shifted from a bond based on deep emotional connections to one centered on common pursuits. As leisure time increased and men moved to the suburbs, they formed their friendships on the golf course, at the neighborhood block party and in the corporate workplace. The Future of Man Friendships It's a shame that our society's ingrained homophobia prevents men from connecting with each other on a more emotional and physical level. American men are missing out on the benefits of close friendships. Studies reveal that men who have several close friends are generally happier and live longer than men who don't. And yet research shows that the number of friends and confidantes a man has has been steadily dropping for decades, leading to greater isolation and loneliness. It's high time modern men took their place in the glorious history of man friendships. We hope this chapter will help you do just that. Band of Brothers: Making and Keeping Strong Friendships When a young man is in high school or college, making friends comes easily and naturally. Yet when his school years conclude, and especially when he gets married and moves, a man begins to find it quite hard to make new friends and maintain the bond with his old pals. At this point in life, cultivating his friendships takes a little more effort and work, but it is infinitely worth it. Recruiting Your Band of Brothers Fraternize at work. You spend more time with people at work than you do at home. And there are probably some dudes at work that you get along with swimmingly. Instead of keeping them in the work friend category, convert them into friend friends. Go for some drinks after work. Invite them over to your house to watch the game on Saturday. If you're married, go out for dinner with him and his spouse. Meet your neighbors. It's not only serial killers who can accurately be described as "quiet men who kept to themselves." You can sadly live in a neighborhood for ten years and not know the people who live next door to you. But they might turn out to be your future best bud. So don't be a Dahmer. A great way to meet your neighbors is by hosting a party or attending neighborhood events like block parties. If you're feeling particularly brave, just go up and introduce yourself. Join an organization. Part of the difficulty today's men face with making new friends is the isolated nature of their social lives. There's work and home, and not much else. Joining an organization is quite possibly the best way to create a social circle for yourself. Manly Advice: Potential Organizations to Join Fraternal Organizations. They're not just for your grandpa. Fraternal organizations are the perfect conduit for friendship making because they provide all the ingredients needed for brotherly bonding: common ideals, a sense of tradition and responsibility, and a focus on service. While there are several great fraternal organizations out there, it's hard to refute that the Masons are the best. Churches/Religious Organizations. Like fraternal orders, churches are a fruitful place to make man friendships as they are a place where you can find gents with similar values and goals. Many churches have groups that are for men only and are designed for both fellowship and spiritual growth. Sports Leagues. If you love sports, instead of spending your weekend alone watching them on TV, join an intramural league and get back on the field. From flag football to ultimate frisbee, your town is sure to have clubs that meet for some good old-fashioned man competition. Joining up will whip you into shape, feed your man spirit and give you the kind of bond with other men that can only be found on the playing field. Toastmasters. Toastmasters solves two fundamental problems in the life of modern man: a lack of friends and a deficiency in the art of public speaking. Not only will you learn to be a better orator, you'll also meet lots of other men to befriend. Book Clubs. For some reason (read: Oprah), book clubs have become associated with women, baring one's soul and Kleenex. But there's nothing sissy about books; discussing great literature was a pastime of many of the great men in history. Libraries sometimes offer male-only book clubs that read books men like. If your library doesn't, why not start one at your house? Keeping Your Friendships Alive "Good fellowship and friendship are lasting, rational and manly pleasures." —William Wycherley Set a common goal. Men experience the greatest bond when they are working together toward a common purpose, i.e., when they become a band of brothers. The same is true whether you're storming Omaha Beach or simply living in the burbs. So set a goal to attain with your friend or a group of friends. Decide to run a marathon, quit smoking or lose weight. Don't forget to set up a system to ensure accountability. Create a competition. Competition in life can drive people apart; a friendly competition among men can bring them together. Create a competition with your friends and set a friendly wager; something a bit embarrassing for the loser is always fun and will keep the group motivated. Figure 2.2 A friendly competition among men can bring them together. Take a mancation. Mancations are occasions for pure, uninterrupted male bonding. They can be as short as a weekend or as long as a week. The destination can be anywhere, but it should involve manly activities. The key to the mancation is to make it an immutable tradition. Set a time and make it an annual happening. You can plan the other things in your life around that nonnegotiable date. Guys' night out. The cliché of the "guys' night out" involves a man ditching his unhappy wife and household chores to spend time with his boys. So let's be clear here: Your wife and her needs should always come first. At the same time, if you and she have spent ample time together, then guys' night out is quite appropriate. Encourage her to have a girls' night out as well. The quality of your relationship will improve as a result of having healthy friendships. Staying in Touch with Your Buds Any relationship, including the man friendship, needs communication to survive. Most guys aren't keen on having heart-to-hearts. Spending regular time together, even without much talking can be enough. But if you move to different locales, you'll have to make an effort to stay in touch. Guys generally don't enjoy talking on the phone, and we usually aren't big e-mail writers either. But there is a long-standing, centuriesold tradition that has kept man friends connected over whole lifetimes: letter writing. Snail mail may have fallen out of favor with most of society, but it's key in maintaining healthy friendships. Sure e-mail is easy, but it's also easily ignored. We let it sit there and in a few days it has disappeared to another page and out of our brains. Letter writing is something altogether different: Real and tangible, it leaves your hands and physically plants itself in the life of your friend. There it is, a part of you, sitting on their kitchen counter. People can't throw stuff like that away. A letter practically requires an answer. Commit to writing your friend once a month; it will keep alive your bond no matter where life takes the both of you. Learn the Secret Handshake: Join a Fraternal Lodge You see their emblems next to the "Welcome to Anytown, USA" sign when you drive into any locale in America. You can recognize them by a lapel pin they might wear or a bumper sticker they have on their car. And without them driving around in go-carts and three-wheelers, Fourth of July parades as we know them today would cease to exist. They are the thousands of men who belong to fraternal lodges. While fraternal lodges like the Freemasons and Oddfellows are often the butt of jokes or fodder for conspiracy theories, fraternal lodges played an important part in the history of male socialization in America. Becoming a member of a fraternal lodge was once a common rite of passage for American men. It was a way for a man to make new friends, network with others and find meaning in their lives. Your grandpa probably belonged or still belongs to one. Sadly this once vibrant and manly tradition has been on the decline for several decades. But the fraternal lodge is due for a revival. The History of Fraternal Lodges "Friendship is the only thing in the world concerning the usefulness of which all mankind are agreed." —Cicero During the nineteenth century, the number of different fraternal lodges as well as membership in lodges exploded in America. The home, transformed by the period's so-called "cult of domesticity," had become an effeminate, doily-laden foo-foo abode, and men from all walks of life flocked to lodges as bastions of unfettered manliness. The lodge was a man hangout, where men could socialize, play pool, throw back a few and vigorously discuss the pressing issues of the day. Membership in fraternal lodges continued to grow through the early part of the twentieth century, peaked during the 1930s but then quickly began to decline. Men began to find the elaborate rituals of fraternal lodges off-putting, found new sources of entertainment in radio, television and movies, and looked to organized sports and the emerging corporate culture for social opportunities. Additionally, increasing pressure and desire for men to spend more time with their families forced many men to give up lodge life. Today many fraternal lodges are on the verge of extinction. Their ranks are getting older, and young men have very little interest in replacing them. It wouldn't be surprising if in a few decades fraternal lodges began to disappear completely. Why Modern Men Should Join a Fraternal Lodge This manly tradition need not fade away. Fraternal lodges aren't just for your grandpa. You, too, can take part in these manly institutions. Here are five reasons you should look past the silly hats and become a member of a fraternal lodge: 1. You'll be taking part in a storied tradition. This tradition is shared by some of the greatest men in history. George Washington, Isaac Newton, Ben Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt were all Masons. How awesome would it be to join the ranks of these great and noble men? 2. The ritual. Our modern world is sadly lacking in ritual. Even churches are dumping their rituals in order to be more hip and edgy. But ritual is an important part of the human experience. Through ritual we can learn important truths, explore the mysteries of the universe and quiet our busy minds. Also, if you feel like you lack a rite of passage into manhood, the ritual of fraternal lodges can provide one for you. 3. You'll make new friends. Sure, these new friends will probably be seventy-five years old, but who better to glean manly wisdom from? What's great about fraternal lodges is that they attract men from all backgrounds, but who all have the same goal of becoming better men. So you'll get to interact with a wide variety of people. Lodge brothers are extremely loyal to one another and will always have your back. Figure 2.3 Lodge brothers are extremely loyal to one another and will always have your back. 4. You'll become a better man. While most fraternal orders require a belief in a Supreme Being (which is open to personal interpretation), very few require adherence to any set creed, church or political system. Instead fraternities exist to promote and inspire values that all men can get behind such as brotherhood, charity and loyalty. 5. You'll have an opportunity to serve your community. Most men want to give back but don't know where or how to do so. Fraternal lodges will give you the motivation and direction you need to get off the couch and start serving your fellow man. While lodges still provide social activities like sports leagues and parties, their main function these days is to plan and carry out service projects from Habitat for Humanity to pancake breakfast fund-raisers. Giving back to your community is definitely a manly thing to do. And you might even get to pop a wheelie in the local parade. How to Help a Friend With a Problem If you see your buddy going through a rough patch in life, it's only natural to want to offer some advice on how to remedy the situation. But helping a man friend with a problem can be a sticky situation; men don't like heart-to-hearts, they're often too prideful to ask for help and a marathon of watching Sex and the City reruns and eating pints of Ben and Jerry's won't soothe their troubles. So when helping your friend with a problem, you must walk softly and carry a fishing pole. Go do something together. Men tend to be uncomfortable with baring their souls. So instead of sitting your friend down and gazing into his eyes, go jogging, take him fishing or bowling, or play some pool. It's easier to unburden yourself when you're sitting looking outward, instead of face-to-face. In between fishing casts, ask your friend about his problem. Figure 2.4 It's easier to unburden yourself when you're sitting looking outward, instead of face-to-face. Go jogging, take him fishing or bowling, or play some pool. Get the facts. Before you can successfully help someone, you need to know all the facts about the problem. Harness your inner news reporter by asking who, what, when, where and why questions. And make sure you listen attentively while your friend speaks. Enable your friend to discover the solution himself. Men are most likely to follow through with something if they feel like they thought of the idea themselves. And oftentimes a man simply needs to be able to think out loud to come up with the answer to his troubles. Therefore your job as a friend is to act as a facilitator. After you hear your friend's problem, ask him very nonchalantly, "So what do you think you can do to fix your situation?" Usually he'll start listing some things. When he says something that you think would be particularly effective, let him know and explore the idea further. Ask if he wants your advice. If helping them figure out their own solution isn't going anywhere, ask your friend if he would like some advice. By asking before you jump into the fray, you respect your friend's manly pride. If they say no, then it's no great shakes. Just keep fishing or bowling and let your friend know you're always willing to talk about it in the future. Don't bug him about it; that's the man code. Don't preach. Men hate being preached to. Don't put off a smug vibe that makes your friend feel you think you're better than him for being in this pickle. Skip the patronizing sermon of "shoulds" and "musts"; instead offer suggestions. Say, "This is what I would do if I were in your situation," "You could try doing X," or "I once had a similar problem and here's how I handled it." Give 'em some straight talk. Men don't like to be preached to, but they do appreciate a justified kick in the pants. If your friend's been a dunderhead, then you need to call him on the carpet. Talk to him respectfully and honestly, man to man. Sometimes you have to tear a man down to bring him back up. Naturally the specific situation should determine your approach. If the problem is more sensitive, like his girlfriend cheating on him, be more sympathetic. The Mechanics of the Man Hug The transition from the snuggling, hand-holding days of the nineteenth century to the less affectionate modern age has been a bumpy one, leaving man friends confused on how to properly show their affection. A firm, hearty handshake, always appropriate with acquaintances and business colleagues, falls quite short when dealing with one's bosom buddies. Yet, neither are most men looking to spoon the afternoon away. Thus, a man must know how to take the middle path: the man hug. Manly Advice: When to Hug Women hug after their friend returns from a bathroom break. Men ration their hugs, doling them out only on certain occasions. These include: • When you haven't seen a friend for a long time. This is measured in months, not days or weeks. • When a friend shares a bit of good news such as the announcement that he has gotten engaged or impregnated his wife. (If he has impregnated someone other than his wife, substitute a man slap in lieu of a man hug.) • The celebration of a beloved sports team's victory. Man hugs in this case can last far longer and be much more vigorous than normal. How to Perform the International Man Hug Figure 2.5 The International Man Hug. 1. Stand face-to-face. Side hugging, in which one arm, or heaven forbid both arms, are wrapped around the shoulders or torso, and the head and cheek are pressed together is never appropriate. 2. Spread your arms wide to announce your intention of moving in for the hug. This allows your friend to prepare himself and raise his arms in turn. You don't want to catch him off guard and end up pinning his arms to his sides. 3. Commence the hug. Don't linger too long, just a couple of seconds will do. Don't lean your head into your friend's head or neck; this will come off as a nuzzle. 4. Pat your friend on the back with an open hand or closed fist. As opposed to the feminine squeeze for emphasis, the slap is the distinguishing mark of a man hug. 5. Release the hug. Pull your hands and arms briskly away as to avoid the impression that you are caressing your friend as you exit the embrace. How to Perform the American Man Hug ( Figure 2.6 The American Man Hug. Some men in America are not even completely comfortable with the fully embracing style of hugging, even when done correctly. For men who cannot quite bring themselves to use both arms in the hug, the American Man Hug is an appropriate compromise. 1. Begin with a traditional firm handshake 2. Keeping your hand clasped with your buddy, wrap the left arm around the shoulder of your friend. 3. Slap your friend's back two times. As in the international style, the back slap is key. 4. Release embrace. Beyond G-Strings and Keg Stands: Throwing a Classy Bachelor Party One of the great traditions of male friendship is the holding of a bachelor party before a buddy gets hitched. Done right, the bachelor party can serve as a memorable weigh station in a man's important rite of passage from single dude to manly husband. The History of the Bachelor Party Men may be surprised to learn that the tradition of having a bachelor party is rooted in ancient times. The Spartans, who originated the idea in the fifth century b.c., would hold a dinner for the groom-to-be on the night before his wedding. The evening would be spent feasting and toasting the groom and each other. The tradition of having a "bachelor's dinner" continued into modern times. In the 1940s and 1950s the occasion was called a "gentlemen's dinner." It was thrown by the groom's father and involved the same toasting and eating that the Spartans had enjoyed. These bachelor dinners were designed for male bonding and to celebrate the groom-to-be's important rite of passage from single life to marriage. Some time during the last few decades, the dinner was dropped and a party took its place. Breaking bread and toasting were exchanged for, or supplemented with, strippers, gambling and copious amounts of alcohol. Fortunately these kinds of parties have been going out of style of late. Such parties neither honor the bride-to-be, who will be stressed by the temptations her fiancé may succumb to, nor respect your friend, who has likely reached a point of maturity in which he feels ready to get married and settle down. So instead of viewing a bachelor party as your friend's last chance for debauchery, a party should really serve as a golden opportunity for male bonding, a chance to do activities that may become less frequent post-marriage and a time to blow off any prenuptial jitters. Planning and Executing a Gentlemanly Bachelor's Party If you are selected to be your friend's best man in his wedding, the job of planning this ancient tradition rests on your shoulders. Following these steps will ensure that you honor your best friend with a bachelor's party that is both classy and enjoyable. Pick an Activity The first step in planning a bachelor party is to choose an activity to center the party around. Just because your fiesta won't involve stuffing dollar bills into G-strings doesn't mean you can't get your jollification on. There are plenty of other activities that will unleash your testosterone and get your heart pumping. Here are just a few ideas: • Rent Jet Skis for a day on the water • Go snow skiing or snowboarding • Attend a professional or collegiate sporting event • Attend a boxing or mixed martial arts match • Spend the day golfing Figure 2.7 The first step in planning a bachelor party is to choose an activity to center the party around. For example, you could spend the day golfing. • Take a deep-sea fishing trip, charter a fishing boat or take a lesson in fly-fishing • Plan a game of a football, basketball, soccer or bowling • Play a poker tournament • Go play paintball • Take a camping or backpacking trip As you're choosing an activity, keep these tips in mind: • Don't do anything insanely dangerous. You want to have fun, but you don't want to risk breaking one of the groom's limbs. He'll find it difficult to go scuba diving on his honeymoon with a cast on his leg. • It's nice to surprise your friend with what he'll be doing at his party, but be sure to cater to his personality and interests. • Consider the relative budgets of your friends. You don't want some of the groom's friends to skip the party because they can't afford to come. • After you choose an activity for the bachelor's party, plan for a meal to follow it. If the weather is warm, a backyard cookout makes an excellent choice. If it's cooler, or you simply desire something more formal, rent a room at your friend's favorite restaurant. • At the dinner, encourage your friends to make funny roasts and poignant toasts. They may also wish to impart words of wisdom to the groom. If you have some advice or want to say things that won't be included in your best man speech, contribute to the toasting. Choose a Date There are several considerations to take into account when planning the date of the party. While it is tempting to have the party the night before the wedding when all the guests are in town, this is not an appropriate choice. The groom needs to be sharp for the next day's ceremony, not all tuckered out. Also, a rehearsal dinner is often planned for the same night and would conflict with your party. So choose a date several weeks before the wedding. If many of the groom's friends live out-of-state, you may want to push it back even further, so they need not make the same trip twice in a short period of time. Send Out the Invitations Invite all the men in the wedding party and all of the groom's good friends and male relatives with whom he is close. Traditionally it is considered impolite to invite people to prewedding functions that are not invited to the wedding itself. Yet this rule has always been applied more ambiguously when it comes to bachelor parties. If the groom is having a very small wedding or a destination wedding, it may be appropriate to invite friends who are not invited to the main event. Consult with the groom as you compile the guest list. Send out the invitations about three weeks before the party. The invitations should match the party's level of formality. If the party is to be formal, send quality handwritten invitations through the mail. If the party is going to be a more casual affair, a phone call or e-mail will do. If the party will involve an activity such as the ones mentioned above, include information such as the cost, meeting place and time, maps, etc. Each invitee should be responsible for paying for the cost of himself and chipping into the cost for the groom. In the invitation, include a respectful request for a check to be sent to you for the appropriate amount. Give a Best Man Speech That Won't Make People Cringe At some point in your life, one of your buddies or your brother will probably ask you to be the best man in his wedding. This is a great honor. One of the duties of a best man is to give a speech wherein you say a few kind words about your friend/brother and his new wife. If you've been to many weddings, you know that oftentimes best man speeches can quickly devolve into an awkward, drunken spectacle. The mixture of booze and lack of preparation results in the best man rambling and sharing inappropriate and embarrassing stories about the groom in front of hundreds of family and friends. If you don't want to make yourself look like a classical ignoramus and you want to truly be the best man, here are a few pointers to keep in mind as you prepare to give your speech: Prepare. Don't walk into the wedding reception thinking you'll know exactly what to say when you get there. If you have a few months before the wedding, start mulling over some ideas for the speech. Begin brainstorming and jotting down thoughts, stories, jokes and quotes you might want to use. If you don't know a lot about how your buddy and his wife met, ask. Think of stories from you and your buddy's past that show what a great guy he is. The goal of the speech is to celebrate the couple and make them look good. Stay sober. Sure, you want to enjoy yourself, and yes, alcohol may help take the edge off of giving a speech in front of hundreds of strangers, but make sure you're not sloppy drunk when you give your speech. You don't want to be completely uninhibited or you might say something you'll regret later on. Besides, a real man doesn't need a crutch to help him tackle a challenge. Be man enough to postpone your own gratification until after the speech is completed. Tell a story that makes a connection. The ideal way to structure a best man speech is to find a connection between a story about your friend and your support for the couple. Share a story about how your friend would always lament that he would never find a woman with x,y and z qualities, but how he finally did in his new bride. Or tell a story about the moment when you were hanging out with the couple and you realized your friend had found his match. Another good angle is to talk about the way that the bride and groom balance one another. Relate a funny (not embarrassing, see below) anecdote in which one of your buddy's personality traits tripped him up in some way. For example, the story could be about how your friend is very shy and how this shyness caused some humorous event to occur. You then talk about how bubbly and outgoing his bride is, and how they therefore make a perfect team. Avoid controversial, offensive or embarrassing topics. You would think this is common sense, but people somehow forget this when they're standing with a microphone in their hand in front of a crowd of people. What gets people in trouble is attempting to be funny by sharing an embarrassing story or cracking some lame joke about a ball and chain. Such shtick usually bombs. It's okay to share a humorous anecdote, but not one that gets laughs at the expense of your friend and his new wife and embarrasses them and their guests. Figure 2.8 Avoid controversial, offensive or embarrassing topics in your best man speech. Avoid inside jokes. If you want to keep people's attention, save the inside jokes for when it's just you and your friend. Keep it short. Nothing irritates people more than some rambling drunk going on and on and on. People have probably already listened to the maid of honor and the bride's father give their spiel. By the time they get to you, the crowd is ready to eat cake and get on with it. Shoot for no more than five minutes. Other don'ts. Don't talk about the groom's past relationships, don't tell people what you really thought of your buddy's wife when you first met her, don't slam the food, don't make comments about looking forward to the honeymoon while winking at the bride—basically just use some tact and class. Remember to be yourself. No need to get formal or try to be someone you're not. And there's no need to follow these instructions exactly either. Simply use them as a guide and be yourself. Let it flow naturally. Use your natural voice and mannerisms. Make it personal and sincere and say things from the heart and you should be golden. Manly Advice: Best Man Speech Crib Sheet 1. Open by thanking those who made the day possible. Single out the bride and groom's parents by name, and offer a toast to them for not only putting on the wedding but for raising two fine people. Thank the guests for coming. 2. Transition to your speech: "I am especially glad to be here on this occasion to celebrate this wonderful day with my friend/brother." 3. Talk about how you know the groom, why you're grateful for having him as your friend and why he's such an upstanding guy. 4. Share a story about your friend and connect it to the couple. 5. Raise your glass and say something to the effect of: "Here's to a lifetime of happiness and love for ____ and ____!" 6. Let out a sigh of relief.<o:p></o:p></p><div class="mb_sig"></div></div>
